=== YAML and JSON
Dashboards are created using YAML format where you declare datasets, pages and its blocks of visualization. Dashboards created with YAML run in client-only Dashbuilder installation accessing JSON/CSV datasets. 

To get start with YAML check out the YAML Guide in this documentation and our https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-samples/tree/main/samples[online samples].

The code from the YAML Guide can be tried on our https://start.kubesmarts.org/[online editor]!
